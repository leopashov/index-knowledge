    "# Alchemix Code Review\n",
    "## Intro\n",
    "This document will contain the main information on the unpicking of the alchemix code. Additional/ supporting documents can be put in the 'alchemixStudy' folder.\n",
    "This will serve as a central reference of our understanding of the alchemix smart contracts.\n",
    "## Key questions\n",
    "While understanding the code, we should pay special attention to the following, as they will be useful in our project:\n",
    "* How are Yearn yields tracked? - this will be key for us as we must monitor yields coming in from yearn, to be able to show users their renumeration for performing rebalancing actions.\n",
    "* Security - which security features have been implemented? Which seem different to standard (perhaps whitelisting)? Would these be useful for us?\n",
    "* Which contracts can we leverage? - contracts such as wEth gateway and yearn token adaptor should be useful to us and we can implement them directly in a diamond pattern. Are there any others?\n",
    "### Yearn Yields\n",
    "function _preemptivelyHarvest(line 1002 AlchemistV2.sol)  \n",
    "![preemptively harvest definition](./IMG/_preemptiveHarvest.png \"preemptively harvest\")  \n",
    "Worth checking how yearn yield works - do number of yvault tokens increase over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "### YieldTokenParams\n",
    "A struct defined in IAlchemistV2State.sol defining yield token parameters.\n",
    "It is inherited by IAlchemistV2 which is inherited by AlchemistV2.sol.\n",
    "It kind of acts as a bit of a glossary of terms:  \n",
